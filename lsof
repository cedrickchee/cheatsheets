# lsof stands for list open files
# What lsof tells you is, for each open file:
# pid, file type (directory? socket? FIFO? regular?),
file descriptor, user, filename / socket address

# To list all IPv4 network files:
sudo lsof -i4

# To list all IPv6 network files:
sudo lsof -i6

# To list all open network sockets:
# Sockets are files.
lsof -i
lsof -i -n -P   # -n & -P mean "don't resolve host names/ports" (also -Pni)

# To list all listening ports:
lsof -Pnl +M -i4

# To find which program is using the port 80:
lsof -i TCP:80

# To list all connections to a specific host:
lsof -i@192.168.1.5

# To list all processes accessing a particular file/directory:
lsof <path>

# To list all files open for a particular user:
lsof -u <username>

# To list all files/network connections a command is using:
lsof -c <command>

# To list the files a PID (Process ID) has open:
lsof -p <PID>

# To list all files open mounted at /mount/point:
# (Particularly useful for finding which process(es) are using a mounted USB stick or CD/DVD.)
lsof +f -- <mount-point>

# To find deleted files:
# You can recover open deleted files from /proc/<PID>/fd/<fd>. PID is process
# that opened the file.
lsof | grep deleted

# Another way to list open sockets is:
netstat -tunapl # tunapl sounds like "tuna, please ^-^"
