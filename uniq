# uniq is for unique

# To show all lines without duplication:
# (`sort -u` and `uniq` have the same effect.)
sort <file> | uniq

# To show not duplicated lines:
sort <file> | uniq -u

# To show duplicated lines only:
sort <file> | uniq -d

# To count each line it saw:
sort <file> | uniq -c

# To count not duplicated lines:
sort <file> | uniq -uc

# To count only duplicated lines:
sort <file> | uniq -dc

# To uniquifies adjacent matching lines:
# Notice there are still two 'a's.
printf 'a\nb\nb\na\nc\nc' | uniq

# Get a deduplicated list of lines:
# sort -u does the same thing
printf 'a\nb\nb\na\nc\nc' | sort | uniq

# Get the top 3 most common lines in a file:
sort <file> | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 3
