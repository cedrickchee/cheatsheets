# tail shows the last 10 lines.
# Very useful for log files.

# To show the last 10 lines of <file>:
tail <file>

# To show the last <number> lines of <file>:
tail -n <number> <file>

# To show the last lines of <file> starting with <number>:
tail -n +<number> <file>

# To show the last <number> bytes of <file>:
tail -c <number> <file>

# To show the last 10 lines of <file> and to wait for <file> to grow:
tail -f <file>

# Keep trying to open file if it's inaccessible:
tail --retry

# Stop when process PID stops running
tail --pid PID

# Usually tail -f will follow a file descriptor.
# --follow=name will keep following the same filename, example if the logfile
# is rotated.
tail --follow=<name>
