# less is a pager
# It lets you view (not edit) text files or piped in text.
# Many vim shortcuts work in less.

# To disable the terminal refresh when exiting:
less -X

# To save the contents to a file:
# Method 1 - Only works when the input is a pipe
s <filename>

# Method 2 - This should work whether input is a pipe or an ordinary file:
Type g or < (g or less-than) | $ (pipe then dollar) then cat > <filename> and Enter.

# Displays bash escape codes as colours
ls --color | less -r

# Run a command when less starts
less +G         # start at end of file
less +30%       # start 20% into file
less +/hello    # search for 'hello' right away
