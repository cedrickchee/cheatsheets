# cat concatenates files

# To display the contents of a file:
cat <file>

# To display file contents with line numbers
cat -n <file>

# To display file contents with line numbers (blank lines excluded)
cat -b <file>

# You can use cat as a basic text editor:
cat > <file>    # Run that. Then, type the contents. Press Ctrl+d to finish

# cats a gzipped file:
# zcat is just 1-line shell script that runs `gzip -cd`, but easier to
# remember.
zcat

# Write its stdin to both stdout and file:
tee <file>

# Redirect to a file owned by root
sudo echo "hello" >> <file>        # will open file as your user, not as root
echo "hello" | sudo tee -a <file>  # will open file as root
